This readme is going to talk about the steps that we are taking to make sure that the code we are
writng is acceptable and making sense as far as the scope of this project is concerned. 

Some of the main issues that we have had while attmepting this project are what the best use case for a product like this is going to be.

If we will be able to actually do some sort of machine learning to create a MVP and if that product can be tested and useable 

Can we process the data correctly to be able to find what we are looking for. Or that is get out machine learning tools pointed in the right direction to find what it is that we are looing for. 

During the setup of the project we looked at the way in which identifying a bot can be done and the ways that we would need to examine accounts to determine if they are a bot with the eye test. Things like the contents of the post and the interaction that they were having with other bots. Also the age of the account and how old each of the accounts are. All of these are something that a person would take into account when looking at a bot. But a good bot can beat those eye tests for some time and needs to be observed over time. 

Looking at data collected from twitter users we have lists of key words as well as hashtags and the date tweets are made of accounts that are confirmed to be either bots or not bots. Using a trend line and seperating the bots and people using tensorflow we were able to acheive over a 90% accuracy on the test results
